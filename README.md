> A chunked upload tool designed to bypass large file limitations on CodeMao, ensuring reliable file transfer (v5.3+)

## üöÄ Core Features (v5.3+)

### Technical Enhancements
- **Full Migration to Material Design 3 (M3) Theming System**:
    - Built upon CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for dynamic switching.
    - Provides refined Light and Dark theme modes.
- **Smart Chunking Strategy**:
  - Dynamic chunk calculation (1MB min / 15MB max)
  - Auto-disable chunking for small files (‚â§1MB)
  - Buffer streaming segmentation (Uint8Array optimized)
- **Advanced Concurrency Control**:
  - Parallel upload limit (2 concurrent requests max)
  - Dynamic request rate control (‚â§5 requests/sec)
- **Reliability Optimization**:
  - Chunk retry with dynamic timeout (10s~300s, calculated based on chunk size)
  - Three-level retry mechanism (exponential backoff: 1s/2s/4s)
  - Real-time concurrency counter (`activeUploads` tracking)
- **Local Persistence**:
  - Operation logs with pagination support (1000 entries max, though pagination UI isn't implemented)
  - Upload history deduplication (link hash-based)

### UX Improvements
- **Fixed Toast Notification Animations**: Restored native slide/fade effects from Toastify.js by resolving CSS transition conflicts.
- **Enhanced Status Monitoring**:
  - Real-time chunk progress (e.g., `Uploading... (x/y chunks complete)`)
  - ETA calculation (based on historical speeds)
- **Component Refactoring**:
  - Independent debug logger component (clear/export support)
  - History table styled according to M3 Light/Dark themes
  - Theme transition animations optimized (smooth CSS variable transitions)

|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UI & Styling**    | Material Design 3 (M3), CSS Custom Properties (Variables), Toastify.js                |
| **Network Layer**   | `AbortController` + Dynamic timeout strategy (chunk size-based)                       |
| **File Handling**   | Streams API + Blob merging (browser memory optimized)                                 |
| **State Management**| Vue Reactivity System (`ref`, `computed`) + `localStorage` (auto JSON serialization) |
| **Error Handling**  | Three-layer error catching (network/business/user)                                    |
| **Build Optimization**| Vite (assumed) + Smart chunk splitting (vendor auto-separation)                       |

## üñ•Ô∏è Quick Start

### Deployment
```bash
# Local development (hot-reload)
npm install
npm run dev

# Production build (PWA support)
npm run build
```

### Vercel One-Click Deploy
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/CJackHwang/FlowChunkFlex)

### Workflow
1. **File Selection**: Drag & drop area with hover feedback (30MB max recommended, though larger might work)
2. **Mode Toggle**: Smart chunking toggle (auto-enabled for files >1MB)
3. **Upload Monitoring**:
   - Real-time chunk progress status
   - Server response time metrics (visible in debug logs)
4. **Result Handling**:
   - Smart URL parsing (supports `[filename]chunk1,chunk2,...` format)
   - Browser stream merging for download (auto CDN path assembly)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Configurations

### Network Layer (MainContent.vue)
```javascript
const UPLOAD_URL = 'https://api.pgaot.com/user/up_cat_file'; // Upload endpoint
const REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT = 5;  // Max requests per second
const CONCURRENT_LIMIT = 2;    // Parallel upload threads
const MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 15 * 1024 * 1024; // Max chunk size 15MB
const MIN_CHUNK_SIZE = 1 * 1024 * 1024;  // Min chunk size 1MB
```

### Chunking Strategy (MainContent.vue)
```javascript
// Dynamic timeout calculation (based on chunk size, in ms, range: 10s - 5min)
const sizeMB = chunk.size / (1024 * 1024);
const calculatedTimeout = 10000 + sizeMB * 6000; // 10s base + 6s per MB
const dynamicTimeout = Math.min(Math.max(calculatedTimeout, 10000), 300000);

// Buffer management
let buffer = new Uint8Array(CHUNK_SIZE);
let bufferPos = 0; // Current buffer write position
```

## üîí Compliance & Security

1. **Data Privacy**:
   - All operation logs and history are stored solely in the browser's `localStorage`.
   - No third-party tracking or analytics SDKs are embedded (pure frontend implementation).
2. **Content Moderation**:
   - Uploaded file results are subject to CodeMao CDN's content moderation policies.
   - Potential blocking of illicit content is handled server-side by the CDN provider.
3. **Licensing**:
   - The project codebase is licensed under GPL-3.0.
   - Commercial use of this tool, especially leveraging CodeMao's non-public APIs, is prohibited.

## ü§ù Contribution Guide

1. **Coding Standards**:
   - Adhere to Vue3 `<script setup>` syntax conventions.
   - Use `ref`/`computed` for reactive state management.
   - Employ clear function naming and appropriate comments.
2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Test chunking logic with various file sizes (including >100MB).
   - Simulate slow network conditions and network errors using browser dev tools.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README if core configurations are modified or new features are added.
   - Add new components to the "Components" section.
